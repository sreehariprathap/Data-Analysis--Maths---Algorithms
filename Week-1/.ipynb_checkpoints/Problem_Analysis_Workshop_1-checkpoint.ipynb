    "#### Amazon Recruitment Automation And Gender Bias Case Study\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2015 Amazon found out a serious issue with the automated tool used in recruitment. The tool was designed to filter and rank the resumes based on job requirements. To train their model Amazon relied on previous decade data consisting of the resumes that were submitted, the corresponding job descriptions and the subset of resumes that were finally hired. The model was giving undue advantage for male applicants over females especially for the technical positions due to the inherent bias historically. This resulted in the model giving higher priority for resumes in the male perspective than the female one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How can we track it?\n",
    "In this context, tracking the bias in the automated recruitment tool is crucial. Monitoring its performance and ensuring that it doesn't favor male applicants over female applicants or any other demographic group is essential. Tracking would involve evaluating the modelâ€™s output, analyzing the impact of changes made to the model, and ensuring fairness across different gender, racial, and socioeconomic groups.\n",
