    "\n",
    "In 2015 Amazon found out a serious issue with the automated tool used in recruitment. The tool was designed to filter and rank the resumes based on job requirements. To train their model Amazon relied on previous decade data consisting of the resumes that were submitted, the corresponding job descriptions and the subset of resumes that were finally hired. The model was giving undue advantage for male applicants over females especially for the technical positions due to the inherent bias historically. This resulted in the model giving higher priority for resumes in the male perspective than the female one.\n",
